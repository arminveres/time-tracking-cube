# Intro

This document is for the planning of the upcoming project **Time Tracking Cube**

## Goals

- The cube should track time spent on doing tasks, which can be specified by setting it to one side and starting the timer.

- Data should be available to the user in some manner

  - Self-hosted website (by pico)
  - BLE advertising and app (ugh, please no :))
